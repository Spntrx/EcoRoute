## What is EcoRoute

Making green choices when travelingâ€”we're here to help!
EcoRoute is here to help you make environmentally conscious choices when traveling from A to B.

We're making it easy for you to learn more about the environmental impact of your travel choices by helping you understand the CO2 emission of your trip. Simply choose what travel options you want to consider for your route, enter your destination and origin, and we're giving you all the insights you need to make a green choice.

We're even taking the current weather into account to tell you if it's a good time to walk or take the bike. So get ready, hit the search button, and help us protect our planet!

## Motivation
This project was created to help inform individuals about their carbon footprints, and help them make informed decisions regarding their travel choices.
